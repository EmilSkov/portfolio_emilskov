      <h2>24hours game project</h2>
      <p>We were a group of 3 people who got an idea of making a mobile game, we had many different ideas for a game, but we decided that it would be a game for the endlessrunner genre.
		  <br><br>
        We were brainstorming about how the virsuelle should look like and what game mechanics should be in the game.
		  <br><br>
        The game ended up being in retro style and was made for android mobiles and could be downloaded from the google play store.</p>
